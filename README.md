# Complete Coding Standards 2023

The conventions described repository are just something I (Edwin Bj√∂rlin) use. I got tired of always coming up with new systems for each project so that is why I've documented my thought process. If you find these logical I suggest you use it aswell, otherwise try to come up with a system that suits you. Happy coding!
