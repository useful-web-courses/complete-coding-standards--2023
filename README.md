# Complete Coding Standards 2023

#### The conventions described below are just something I (Edwin Bj√∂rlin) use. I got tired of always coming up with new systems for each project so that is why I've documented my thought process below. If you find this logical I suggest you use it aswell, otherwise try to come up with a system that suits you. Happy coding!

### Logical sizing
thin, thicker, thickest
small, medium, large
narrow, regular, wide

---

### Alphabetical
Look at first letter, if same, look at 2nd, third and so on
If one word is identical in the beginning like padding and padding-left, then padding should be on top.

#### Example:
--color--background: #FFFFFF;
--color--faint: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
--color--text-primary: #000000;

---

### spacing between
2 or more that starts with same letter spacing around them
